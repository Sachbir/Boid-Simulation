# Boid-Simulation

This is a fun exploration of emergent behaviors from a very simple ruleset, inspired by some very peculiar behavior in my Ants project. The rules of Boids are as follows: 

1. Separation - avoid crowding local boids
2. Alignment - aim towards the average direction of local boids
3. Cohesion - move towards the center of local boids

As of now, I have completed the basic model, and have started on a few additions. The current model has an improved avoidance system adapted from the separation rules that avoids other objects as well. 

In the future, I plan on adding a predator-prey dynamic before I consider this finished.
